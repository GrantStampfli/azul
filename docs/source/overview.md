# Overview

Azul.js has been designed to be the most elegant relational database ORM for
Node.js.

The API has been designed to allow clear, understandable, and easy access to
underlying data. It takes inspiration from [many][django] [other][rails] ORM
tools that have come before it. If you've used an ORM before, you'll feel
right at home with Azul.js.

## What sets Azul.js apart?

From the beginning, Azul.js was created with ease of use and quality in mind.
Focus has been placed on expressiveness of the API, documentation, security,
[code quality][azul-codeclimate], and [test coverage][azul-coveralls].

We're proud to have:

  - An API that provides flexibility while remaining clear & easy to use
  - Documentation for all functions (including internal functions)
  - 100% test coverage (including branches)
